Can you explain each and every keywords used in jargon of Active Directories

Sure, here is an explanation of some of the common terms and keywords used in the jargon of Active Directory:

    Domain: A domain is a logical grouping of network resources, such as computers, users, and devices, that share a common security boundary. A domain is typically administered by a domain controller.

    Forest: A forest is a collection of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog.

    Domain Controller: A domain controller is a server that runs the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role and is responsible for managing authentication and authorization, maintaining the directory database, and providing other domain-related services.

    Organizational Unit (OU): An OU is a container object in Active Directory that can be used to organize and manage objects, such as users, groups, and computers, within a domain.

    Group Policy: Group Policy is a feature of Active Directory that allows administrators to define policies for user and computer objects in a domain. These policies can be used to configure settings, such as desktop configurations, security settings, and software installation.

    Kerberos: Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that is used by Active Directory to authenticate users and computers on a network.

    LDAP: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used to access and manage directory information in Active Directory.

    Global Catalog: The global catalog is a distributed data repository in Active Directory that contains information about all objects in the forest. It is used to support searches across multiple domains in a forest.

    Domain Name System (DNS): DNS is a protocol used to translate domain names into IP addresses. In Active Directory, DNS is used to locate domain controllers and other network resources.

    Schema: The schema defines the structure and attributes of objects in Active Directory. It specifies what types of objects can be created and what attributes those objects can have.
